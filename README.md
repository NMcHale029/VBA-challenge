# VBA-challenge

Script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs: 
  The ticker symbol
  Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  The total stock volume of the stock

Script returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

Script runs for every year all at once.

I watched a YouTube video (linked below) to learn how to loop a macro through each sheet of a workbook.
